                    <br> Black Forces are hard at work on brand new, hand drawn collectible trading cards. 
                    The cards serve as avatars for both members of Black Forces, as well as collaborators.  
                    These cards will be printed in limited quantities and issued as pre-order bonuses for purchasing
                    our upcoming EP: Planetary Eclipse.
                    <br>
                    <br>We look forward to sharing our full vision with all of you when new card types and rare limited prints 
                    are ready to be unveiled. 
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Stay Tuned for more details, but in the meantime check out our gallery of trading cards below!
